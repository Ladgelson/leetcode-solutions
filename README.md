## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of solutions to various problems from LeetCode, implemented in different programming languages. The goal is to create a comprehensive and organized set of resources that can help developers learn and practice algorithm and data structure problems.

## Features

- **Diverse Languages**: Solutions are available in multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and more.
- **Structured Directory**: Problems are organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and by topic (Arrays, Strings, Trees, etc.).
- **Detailed Explanations**: Each solution includes a detailed explanation of the approach and the code.
- **Test Cases**: Sample test cases are provided to help understand the problem and validate the solutions.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized by difficulty level, problem number, and programming language. Here's an example of the directory structure:

```bash
├── easy
│ ├── 1_two_sum
│ │ ├── c
│ │ │ ├── username
│ │ │ │ ├──README.md
│ │ │ │ └── solution.c
│ │ ├── cpp
│ │ │ ├── username
│ │ │ │ ├──README.md
│ │ │ │ └── solution.cpp
│ │ ├── java
│ │ │ ├── username
│ │ │ │ ├──README.md
│ │ │ │ └── Solution.java
│ │ └── python
│ │ │ ├── username
│ │ │ │ ├──README.md
│ │ │ │ └── solution.py
│ └── ...
├── medium
│ ├── 2_add_two_numbers
│ │ ├── c

│ │ │ │ ├──README.md

│ └── ...
```

Each problem folder is named using the format `problemNumber_problemName` (e.g., `1_two_sum`). Inside each problem folder, there are subfolders for each programming language (e.g., `c`, `cpp`, `java`, `python`). Within each language folder, individual contributors can create a folder named with their GitHub username, containing their solution and a `README.md` file explaining their approach.

### Example:
easy > 1_two_sum > java > Ladgelson

Inside the folder, you will find:

README.md (explaining the solution)
Solution.java (the code of the solution)


## Getting Started
